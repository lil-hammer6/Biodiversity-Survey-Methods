## Welcome to the class page for Montana State University's ENSC 410 and LRES 510 course! 💚🍃

### This is still fairly beta-- but let's see if this page can make the assignments for this semester go more smoothly! :bowtie: 
### Posted here will be the intro to R Markdown, homework assignments, and some project information. 
### I can't wait to get this semester underway! ~Lilly 🫀
