# R homework assignment rules
## Here I'm going to list some (loose) rules for the R homeworks. Think of it more as a guide. 
### 1. Don't let yourself get overwhelmed. If I can do it, you can do it. I promise. 
### 2. Read your error messages (don't just panic immediately). The error messages can sometimes be ambiguous, but often they tell you exactly what is wrong (ie. open parentheses)
### 3. If you're not sure what the error means, copy and paste it into google. Nearly every error I've ever had (including the weirdest ones) had some solution on google. 
### 4. If google isn't fixing it, or the solutions aren't working for you, no worries! Send your .rmd file to one of the TAs and we will gladly help! It may be fastest to include all of us on an email, as we are all busy, but someone will get to it ASAP. 
### 5. When you email someone for code help, DO NOT SEND A SCREENSHOT OF YOUR CODE OR THE ERROR. This does not help us! Often we can't see what is causing the error without clicking and scrolling through ourselves. Send the rmd so we can open it up and take a look. 
### 6. We are all busy people, so please do not email us the night (especially after 6pm) an assignment is due with your code errors. We likely won't see it until the next day, and you should get the code running BEFORE the night the assingment is due. 
### 7. Take risks!!! Once you're feeling comfortable with the basics, try fun things like packages to make your figures prettier or adding new colors. If you want to try something like that but don't know where to start, we can get you started!
